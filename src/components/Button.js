        The Artisan Hub aims to bring the best hand made products by New uganda
        artisans together in one online space. We want to tell the story of the
        unique New Ugandan's who put their heart and soul in to their
        products. We have scoured the farmer's markets, collectives and co-ops
        to find the best products from up and down the country. The products you
        find on The Artisan Hub have been curated specifically because they tell
        the story of the area where they were produced and reflect the terroir,
        provenance and the tikanga of the way in which they were lovingly
        crafted. At The Artisan Hub, we believe that New Ugand has some of the
        best cheese in the world and we want give these talented artisans a
        platform to raise awareness and sell their products to New Ugandan's
        who don't have the opportunity to easily get their hands on the
        artisan's beautifully crafted products. Our values Sustainability,
        passion and quality are at heart of everything we do at The Artisan Hub.
        All the products for sale, have been curated by The Artisan Hub team,
        and meet our strict selection criteria. Safety is paramount and non
        negotiable, and we do everything we can to ensure that products are
        prepared, and are transported to you in a safe and secure method. We are
        MPI certified and take the utmost care with preparation and delivery of
        your cheeses. Finally we want to support our fellow New Zealanders. We

        people who live here are what make it so. By purchasing from The Artisan
        Hub, you are boosting the economy of the regions around New Zealand
        where our artisans produce their wonderful products. Who we are Started
        by Dan Jennings in 2020, The Artisan Hub is the product of years of
        discussion, collaboration with a number of talented specialists, and a
        passion for finding the highest quality artisan products produced in New
        Zealand. The journey started some five or more years back when a Cheese
        Club was born at a previous place of work. Every fortnight the team
        would gather together to enjoy the most recently procured dairy treats.
        Wanting to share the experience with others lead to an idea to create a
        business that offered a "Cheese Club" to other businesses and social
        groups. The journey took Dan on a year long stint working at a local
        cheese retailer, as well as numerous trips to artisan cheese producers,
        and farmer's markets to get a broad experience of the best cheeses New
        Zealand had to offer. The Artisan Hub is the culmination of that journey
        and the experience garnered along the way. Dan hope's you will enjoy the
        fruits of that journey as much as he has over the years. Learn more
